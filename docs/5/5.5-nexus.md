# Nexus

In this step we will run the steps below. Be sure to keep enough notes to create
a step-by-step guide showing your experience through this section. Nexus is a
repository manager for Java artifacts and is useful for keeping track of
versions of Snapshots and Releases.

# Exercise 1 - Nexus

In this exercise we will be creating an AWS instance with Jenkins and Nexus installed.

1. Create a new AWS Instance in the same manner that Jenkins master/slave and tomcat were created. Name this instance yourname-nexus and be sure to note the instance-id and Public DNS.
2. `yum` update the machine.
3. Install Nexus using the same steps from week one. The following Nexus guide can be used as an example.
4. Configure your Jenkins petclinic job to deploy SNAPSHOT artifacts to Nexus using AWS Private DNS hostnames.
5. Document a step-by-step guide to show your experience.

### Deliverable

  Be able to deploy an artifact from jenkins onto Nexus and confirm that it had been deployed.

# Exercise 2 - Jenkins to Nexus

### Overview
The folloiwng steps are on deploying artifacts from Nexus to Jenkins. This guide does not specify how to deploy an artifact from Nexus to a target (such as Tomcat). This article is based off the use of AWS for all server instances.

### Prereqs:
- Jenkins installed on a server.
- Nexus Installed on a server.
- Git repository that contains a Java project

1. Set up Nexus
  - Sign in as an Admin user and create Users for Nexus if necessary.
2. Set up Jenkins
  - Create a Maven Jenkins job and use your fork of [spring-petclinic](//github.com/liatrio/spring-petclinic) for git polling
  - Set up the Maven Build information with your `pom.xml` from your project
  - We will need to store our password and admin info for Nexus saved onto the server
    - Create file settings.xml and store it in /var/lib/jenkins/.m2/
      ```
      <!--Example of username/password for the xml-->

      <settings>
        <servers>
          <server>
            <id>snapshots</id>
            <username>snapshots</username>
            <password>thePassword</password>
          </server>
          <server>
            <id>deployment</id>
            <username>deployment</username>
            <password>thePassword</password>
          </server>
        </servers>
      </settings>
      ```
  - Test if our Jenkins isntance is correctly doing `mvn deploy` to our Nexus repository.
3. Setting up the project
  - We need to put all the Nexus info into the pom file under the _distributionManagement_ tag. This is an example:
    ```
    <distributionManagement>
      <snapshotRepository>
        <id>snapshots</id>
        <url>http://ip-172-31-25-3.us-west-2.compute.internal:8081/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>
      </snapshotRepository>
      <repository>
        <id>deployment</id>
        <url>http://ip-172-31-25-3.us-west-2.compute.internal:8081/nexus/content/repositories/releases/</url>
      </repository>
    </distributionManagement>
    ```
  - There are 2 types of Nexus repositories, _snapshots_ and _deployments_. Save these changes and commit it back to your repository.
4. Build the project
  - Build the Jenkins job and confirm that the artifact was successfully deployed.
5. See the artifact in Nexus
  - Go to the nexus GUI in a web browser at either (your-ip-address):8081/nexus or (your-ip-address):8081 and confirm that your artifact has been deployed to Nexus.

### Deliverable
Have a Jenkins job build a project from a code repository and deploy that artifact to Nexus.

# Exercise 3 - Nexus to Tomcat

0: Basic Overview:
  1. Create an ssh key
  2. In the "Manage Jenkins" section of your Jenkins instance, create an ssh server "Tomcat" using the info from your Tomcat instance and the private key of the key you created
  3. Create a "tomcat-deploy" job in Jenkins
  4. Have this "tomcat-deploy" job execute an ssh command from your newly created tomcat server that will deploy a .war file to your Tomcat instance

1: Creating an SSH key
  1. In a directory of your choice run the ssh-keygen command
  2. Ensure that you are familiar with the workings of private keys, and know how to use them properly

2: Create a Tomcat server in "Manage Jenkins"

  In your Jenkins job, fill in the SSH Server section with your Tomcat server info and the private key you created. 

3: Create a tomcat-deploy job in Jenkins

  By this point you are familiar with the process of creating a job in Jenkins. Make one which will run an SSH command on your tomcat server. It is smarter to do this instead of running a post-build action SSH command because you can make this job run on whatever triggers you specify, rather than after a certain job.

4: Execute a command while SSH'd into your Tomcat server

  In the "build" section of your tomcat-deploy job's configurations, select "send files or execute commands over SSH". Select the server you recently created in your "Manage Jenkins" settings in the dropdown box on top. 
  
On your own, research and find a good command that will get the .war file from your nexus and deploy it to the spot that you want. A good place to start your research is at the link below:

### Deliverable

  Have a Jenkins job deploy an artifact from a repository to Nexus, then deploy the artifact from Nexus to Tomcat.

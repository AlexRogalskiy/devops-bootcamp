# Nexus

In this step we will run the steps below. Be sure to keep enough notes to create
a step-by-step guide showing your experience through this section. Nexus is a
repository manager for Java artifacts and is useful for keeping track of
versions of Snapshots and Releases.

# Exercise 1

In this exercise we will be creating an AWS instance with Jenkins and Nexus installed.

1. Create a new AWS Instance in the same manner that Jenkins master/slave and tomcat were created. Name this instance yourname-nexus and be sure to note the instance-id and Public DNS.
2. `yum` update the machine.
3. Install Nexus using the same steps from week one. The following Nexus guide can be used as an example.
4. Configure your Jenkins petclinic job to deploy SNAPSHOT artifacts to Nexus using AWS Private DNS hostnames.
5. Document a step-by-step guide to show your experience.

# Deliverable

Be able to deploy an artifact from jenkins onto Nexus and confirm that it had
been deployed.

# Exercise 2

### Overview
The folloiwng steps are on deploying artifacts from Nexus to Jenkins. This guide does not specify how to deploy an artifact from Nexus to a target (such as Tomcat). This article is based off the use of AWS for all server instances.

### Prereqs:
- Jenkins installed on a server.
- Nexus Installed on a server.
- Git repository that contains a Java project

1. Set up Nexus
  - Sign in as an Admin user and create Users for Nexus if necessary.
2. Set up Jenkins
  - Create a Maven Jenkins job and use your fork of [spring-petclinic](//github.com/liatrio/spring-petclinic) for git polling
  - Set up the Maven Build information with your `pom.xml` from your project
  - We will need to store our password and admin info for Nexus saved onto the server
    - Create file settings.xml and store it in /var/lib/jenkins/.m2/
      ```
      <!--Example of username/password for the xml-->

      <settings>
        <servers>
          <server>
            <id>snapshots</id>
            <username>snapshots</username>
            <password>thePassword</password>
          </server>
          <server>
            <id>deployment</id>
            <username>deployment</username>
            <password>thePassword</password>
          </server>
        </servers>
      </settings>
      ```
  - Test if our Jenkins isntance is correctly doing `mvn deploy` to our Nexus repository.
3. Setting up the project
  - We need to put all the Nexus info into the pom file under the _distributionManagement_ tag. This is an example:
    ```
    <distributionManagement>
      <snapshotRepository>
        <id>snapshots</id>
        <url>http://ip-172-31-25-3.us-west-2.compute.internal:8081/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>
      </snapshotRepository>
      <repository>
        <id>deployment</id>
        <url>http://ip-172-31-25-3.us-west-2.compute.internal:8081/nexus/content/repositories/releases/</url>
      </repository>
    </distributionManagement>
    ```

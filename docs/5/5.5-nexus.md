1. Create a new AWS Instance in the same manner that Jenkins master/slave and tomcat were created. Name this instance yourname-nexus and be sure to note the instance-id and Public DNS.
2. `yum` update the machine.
3. Install Nexus using the same steps from week one. The following Nexus guide can be used as an example.
4. Configure your Jenkins petclinic job to deploy SNAPSHOT artifacts to Nexus using AWS Private DNS hostnames.
5. Document a step-by-step guide to show your experience.

# Deliverable

been deployed.

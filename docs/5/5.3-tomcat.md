# Tomcat :smiley_cat:
In this section you will learn how to configure Tomcat. Tomcat is an open-source Java Servlet container developed by Apache, that provides a Java HTTP web server environment to run and test java code. To find out more about Tomcat, you can browse [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Tomcat).

## Setup Tomcat
1. Configure a new server similar to the one you did for the Jenkins.
2. Make sure to take the common practice and update your server with the newest updates before beginning work.
3. Gather information on requirements to run Tomcat. Think of what type of application Tomcat is and what it may use to run correctly.
4. Next, create a Tomcat user and Tomcat group.
5. Finally, install Tomcat on your server.

# Before moving on
Before continuing, make sure you have two separate servers, with a single application on both.
1. The first server should have Jenkins installed and properly running on its own.
2. The second server should have Tomcat installed and properly running. Refer to the top of this guide if not completed.

## Deploying from Jenkins to Tomcat
1. First, verify both servers are running by visiting the URLs of both.
2. There are two ways you can choose to connect the two applications.
    1. You can add a post-build action that deploys to Tomcat by the use of a Jenkins plugin or the use of [SCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_copy).
    2. You can create a job that specifically deploys to Tomcat. (Best option because it builds modularity into your pipeline).
3. If you went with the first option you first need to create a new user on the Tomcat server and give it sudoers permissions.
4. Create a rsa keypair between the Jenkins server and Tomcat server.
5. Next, you need to configure the job that you want to deploy to Tomcat by adding a post build action and utilizing the Secure Copy Protocol.
6. Browse to Tomcats webapps directory and look for your deployed project. If empty, consider a few things such as permissions, like who has the ability to write to this folder.

# Deliverable
- A working Jenkins server with a job that is able to deliver an artifact to Tomcat's server in which you can get a preview of the application.
- Discussion of the benefits of using a tool like Tomcat in software development.

# Jenkins

Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server which can be used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and delivering or deploying software. Jenkins can be thought of as an orchestrator of tools, controlling the when and how of running tools.

You should already be familiar with using the Jenkins web GUI interface however when setting up a remote server there are instances where there are no interfaces to work with. This section will focus on using the Jenkins CLI to setup a new server and create jobs.

# Jenkins

Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server which can be used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and delivering or deploying software. Jenkins can be thought of as an orchestrator of tools, controlling the when and how of running tools.

When setting up a remote server, there are instances where there are no interfaces to work with. Set up an AWS server to run a jenkins job by using the terminal to set everything up.

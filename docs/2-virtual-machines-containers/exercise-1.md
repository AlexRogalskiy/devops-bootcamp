## Remote Deployment

This is a group exercise. If you are just one person, that's okay; we believe in you! However, try to complete this as a group if possible.

 1. One person should clone their Golden Image again, and they should install Jenkins on it.
 2. Another person should clone their Golden Image again, and they should install Nexus on it.
 3. Each person should forward the correct ports on their Virtual Machine.
 4. Over a network, deploy spring-petclinic from Jenkins to Nexus.

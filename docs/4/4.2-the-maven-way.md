# The Maven Way

Read about [The Maven Way](https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/maven-way%E2%84%A2) over at cloudbees.com.

>"Ant is simply a toolbox whereas Maven is about the application of patterns in order to achieve an infrastructure which displays the characteristics of visibility, reusability, maintainability, and comprehensibility."

A key concept of The Maven Way is convention over configuration. Convention over configuration refers to the idea that sticking to the standard way of doing a build with maven will be relatively painless, but if you do something outside the norm it is possible(but difficult requiring a lot of configuration).

A pom.xml does not require much in order to do a lot of powerful build commands in the Maven Lifecycle. This is possible due to the Convention over configuration principal Maven has an idea of where to put and look for most of the stuff it needs and assumes you placed everything properly.

## Maven Lifecycle

You should be familiar with the Maven lifecycle from the previous section.

Each of these stages happens one after the other, in serial order. This means that when mvn package is ran, Maven also runs validate, compile and test. By using this standard lifecycle, Maven reinforces the notion of convention over customization. This allows any developer to expect that with any Maven project you will have these stages, making the build process globally straightforward.

## Group, Artifact, Version

Read [this page](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-naming-conventions.html) on Maven group ID, artifact ID and version from the official Maven site.

# Deliverable

Discuss The Maven Way and how it can be applied to different tools with your group.


## Exercise 

Clone [spring-petclinic](https://github.com/liatrio/spring-petclinic) and try out each phase of the Maven lifecycle.

## Practice

 1. Create a new application using the archetype.
```
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp
```
 2. Add Jetty to `pom.xml`.
```
<build>
	<plugins>
		<plugin>
			<groupId>org.mortbay.jetty</groupId>
			<artifactId>maven-jetty-plugin</artifactId>
			<version>6.1.10</version>
			<configuration>
				<scanIntervalSeconds>10</scanIntervalSeconds>
				<connectors>
					<connector implementation="org.mortbay.jetty.nio.SelectChannelConnector">
						<port>8080</port>
						<maxIdleTime>60000</maxIdleTime>
					</connector>
				</connectors>
			</configuration>
		</plugin>
	</plugins>
</build>
```
 3. Run Jetty.
```
mvn jetty:run
```
 4. Investigate the Maven Internal (local) repo. What does it contain? What is its purpose?
 5. What changes occur in the project directory and the local repo when running `mvn package` and when running `mvn install`?
 6. Modify dependencies/versions using the POM by opening `pom.xml` and changing the versions of dependencies to get different versions to be used in the project. Locate them in the Maven repo.
 7. Change spring-petclinic's group ID, artifact ID and version.
 8. Alter one of spring-petclinic's open-source dependencies, such as jodatime-hibernate.
   - Change the jodatime dependency in spring-petclinic to use `9.2.1-SNAPSHOT`.
   - After building, the build should fail. Why?
 9. Clone jodatime and create a new version of the plugin.
   - Change the version to be the missin version from before.
   - Build the "new" version which is stored in the local Maven repo.
 10. Run spring-petclinic build and verify it was successful.

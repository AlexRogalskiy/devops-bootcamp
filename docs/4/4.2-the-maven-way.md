# The Maven Way

Read about [The Maven Way](https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/maven-way%E2%84%A2) over at cloudbees.com.

>"Ant is simply a toolbox whereas Maven is about the application of patterns in order to achieve an infrastructure which displays the characteristics of visibility, reusability, maintainability, and comprehensibility."

A key concept of The Maven Way is convention over configuration. Convention over configuration refers to the idea that sticking to the standard way of doing a build with maven will be relatively painless, but if you do something outside the norm it is possible(but difficult requiring a lot of configuration).

A pom.xml does not require much in order to do a lot of powerful build commands in the Maven Lifecycle. This is possible due to the Convention over configuration principal Maven has an idea of where to put and look for most of the stuff it needs and assumes you placed everything properly.

## Maven Lifecycle

You should be familiar with the Maven lifecycle from the previous section.

Each of these stages happens one after the other, in serial order. This means that when mvn package is ran, Maven also runs validate, compile and test. By using this standard lifecycle, Maven reinforces the notion of convention over customization. This allows any developer to expect that with any Maven project you will have these stages, making the build process globally straightforward.

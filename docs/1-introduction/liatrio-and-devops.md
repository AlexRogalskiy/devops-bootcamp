# Liatrio and DevOps

This might be your first apprenticeship; if so, congratulations! You might get this question at some point.

> "What do you all _do_?"

Well...

We are a consulting firm aimed at helping large corporations increase their productivity and ability to deliver and deploy software in a timely manner. Another way to look at it is by asking the following question.

> How long does it take for your company to deploy software with one line of code difference?

Sometimes the answer is staggering, and we try to change that.

## Boots on the Ground

Liatrio is a boots-on-the-ground DevOps Consulting group, meaning that our teams are actually on-site working face-to-face with clients to help them streamline their production. We work with a multitude of clients, and each one has their own specific issues. This is why it is so important to be working personally with them; our employees identify issues that hinder development and help produce a solution. We help to uplift clients both technologically and culturally to revitalize development and IT teams.

## The Rise of DevOps

DevOps has revolutionized software development within the last couple decades. At the turn of the century, it was common that development teams would work on independent pieces of a project, which would ultimately have to be merged and compiled by a tech lead at the end of a project. This lead to an enormous problem. If code didn't merged together and function as expected, a team might not know until very late in the development process, or even until after deploying. Since that time, developers have created processes and tools to help build, test, and manage code throughout the life of a project. Those tools and processes help for the foundation of what we know today as DevOps.

## The Goal
The goal is to take the pain out of software delivery and deployment.

1) The developer gets quick feedback. Fast feedback loops allow the developer to work on their code while their mind is in the right place. Addressing these issues as quickly as possible keeps the integrity of the code base. The developer should be testing their code and verifying that their code is what the product needs.

2) The automation of source code management (SCM) and build servers keep code moving through the pipeline and return feedback to developers. The build server has a very important job despite being seemingly simple.

3) Every build created could potentially go to production. While not every change necessarily needs to be released immediately, it's valuable to have enough automation and validation that any changes _could_ go to production if desired.

4) One of the biggest goals of DevOps is to build a culture similar to startups: Agile mindset. Close Team. Open Communication. Responsibility. Accountability.

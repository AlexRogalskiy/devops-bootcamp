Amazon provides a wide variety of cloud based web services (usually referred to simply as AWS). In the next few sections we will demonstrate use cases for several different AWS services.

# Accounts and billing

The cost of using AWS services often depends on several different factors. For example the cost of running an EC2 instance to host Jenkins would depend on the instance tier, amount of CPU time used and the amount and type of storage. Tier levels generally affect peak performance such the amount of available CPU processing and memory or type of storage. The general rule is you pay for what you use. Amazon provides many free tier, trials and low cost solutions which are helpful for experimenting with new solutions (like the exercises in this bootcamp :) but care should be taken to avoid running up unnecessary bills unintentionally. If you are a Liatrio apprentice talk to you team lead to setup access our AWS accounts otherwise you can [create an account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup).

#### What does AWS Charge For?

AWS charges for services rendered in the form of:

- EC2 instances running.
- Data stored on a volume for the EC2 instances.
- Elastic IP's when the connected instance is stopped or terminated.
- DNS information via AWS' Route53.
- Much More but we won't need to use other products right now.

#### What Services Should We Use?

- EC2 instances during this phase should almost always be t2.micro instances. If you feel like you need bigger then make sure to verify with someone else.
- AWS Volumes in the form of Elastic Block Storage (EBS).
- Elastic IP's and Route53 on specific instances.
   - You shouldn't need them for this phase,  but if you feel like you do then ask.
   - You should be using internal ip's for most of this work, it helps you to understand AWS's internal workings a bit more.

#### Guidelines For Creating An Instance

1. Create the instance with the GUI on AWS or use the CLI with awscli.
2. You should follow the naming convention:
  - _your.name_-_tool_-_name_
  - example: matt-jenkins-master
  - try to keep the names to two dashes
3. Be sure to keep track of your running instances.

#### When Not Using The Instance

Please make sure to stop your instance, not terminate. If you have an elastic IP attached to that instance then deallocate that address.

#### Guidelines For Destroying An Instance

1. Terminate the instance with either the GUI on AWS or use the AWS CLI.
2. Make sure that the following have been deleted as well.
  - EBS Volume for the instance
  - Elastic IP's for the instance.
  - Route53 information

## Exercise

###### Through these steps you will build two servers on AWS, one as a Jenkins master and the other a Jenkins agent.

1. Create a key pair in AWS.
2. Install awscli tool:`$ pip install awscli`

3. Setup awscli. Ask someone to create you an AWS account. Fill in the prompts:

```
$ aws configure
    Access Key:
    Secret Key:
    Default region: us-west-2
    Default output: <leave blank, hit enter>
```

4. Create a Jenkins master instance. **Write down the instance ID:**

```
$ aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-d0f506b0 --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro --key-name liatrio-2016.04.25 --security-groups jenkins | grep InstanceId
```

5. Name your server, replace i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx with your instance ID and replace Justin with your name in lower case:

```
$ aws ec2 create-tags --resources i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx --tags "Key=Name,Value=justin-jenkins-master"
```


6. Find and **write down** the hosts public DNS name. Replace i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx with your instance ID:

```
aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-id i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx | grep PublicDnsName | head -1
```

7. Login to your host. The default username is ec2-user and you will have to use your private key:

```
$ ssh -i liatrio-20160425.pem -l ec2-user ec2-52-36-229-73.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```

8. Use yum to update your system
9. Use yum to install openjdk-1.8.0, wget, and git
  - Be sure to update your default Java version to avoid a _jenkins dead but pid file exists_ error using:
    - ```sudo alternatives --config java```

10. Install Jenkins. Follow this guide from [CloudBees](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Installing+Jenkins+on+Red+Hat+distributions)
11. Browse to your Jenkins instance and setup security immediately! The internet can be a dangerous place as an open Jenkins can be used to run arbitrary commands. (This may no longer be necessary).

- Create an admin user
   - Manage Jenkins > Manage Users > Create user
- Disable anonymous access and grant all access to the admin user:
   - Check Enable Security
   - Access Control > Security Realm > Choose “ Jenkins’ own user database” and uncheck “Allow users to sign up”
   - Access Control > Matrix-based security > Ensure anonymous is fully unchecked and admin is fully checked (to the very right there is a button to check / uncheck all)
     - Manage Jenkins > Configure Global Security

12. To stop your instance at the end of the day:
```
$ aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

13. To start up your instance the next day:
```
$ aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

14. The DNS name is not persistent through shutdown and start. Run step 6 again to get the hostname of your instance.
15. Note we'll need to clean things up by the end of the week as running instances and their storage cost money.

**To permanently destroy and delete your instance:**

```
$ aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
### Create a jenkins agent instance (open ended exercise):

1. Create an instance based on the previous steps and name it yourname-jenkins-agent. Do not install jenkins on the agent however. To use this system as a agent, google for steps. I found these links useful:
   - https://gist.github.com/mgedmin/9547214
   - https://www.caktusgroup.com/blog/2012/01/10/configuring-jenkins-slave/
2. As a high level over view you will need to create a private ssh key for the jenkins user on the jenkins master. A jenkins user will need to be created on the agent and the public key from the jenkins master will need to be added to the authorized keys so the jenkins master can ssh to the jenkins agent and tell it to execute jobs and commands.

## Deliverable

1. Know AWS through the command line.
2. Run multiple application deploys.

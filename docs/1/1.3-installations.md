# Installations

Linux packages are compressed file archives that contain all of the necessary code for a particular application or service relative to your system.

A DevOps Engineer should be very familiar with the quickest ways to obtain software and which situations certain installation methods are suited for.

 - REHL based distros, such as CentOS, use `yum`.
 - Ubuntu uses `apt-get`.
 - Arch uses `pacman`.
 - Macs can make use of [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

## Unavailable Package
Sometimes a package is not available from the central yum/apt repository. In that case, you may need add the repository. If this is an option, the repository url will be available from the repository owner.

The steps are generally...
 1. Download the repository key (wget, curl).
 2. Update your package list.
 3. Install the package.
 4. In yum, this is often done in the etc/yum.repos.d file. With apt-get, this is done with the update.

## Finding Packages
If you know you need a package, but you aren't sure what the name is exactly, you can search for  the package. If you wanted to look for a package titled ‘openjdk’, for example, you might use one of the following three commands.

```
apt-cache search openjdk
yum search openjdk
brew search openjdk
```

# Deliverable

Install what software you think you need on your Mac using Homebrew. Once that is complete, research `brew leaves` and discuss your conclusions.

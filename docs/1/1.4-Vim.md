# Vim
Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing.
It is an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems.
Vim is often called a "programmer's editor," and so useful for programming that
many consider it an entire IDE. It's not just for programmers, though. Vim is
perfect for all kinds of text editing, from composing email to editing
configuration files.

# Modes
Normal editors like Atom or VSCode are considered _modeless_ editors which
means there is only one mode, where you input text. Vim is a _modal_ editor
with three primary modes:

  - Insert -> Insert text as if it was a normal editor
  - Normal -> Send commands to Vim
  - Visual -> Select blocks of text

# Editing Files
To open to files use `vim [filename]`

# Golden Images

 1. Download [CentOS 7](https://www.centos.org/download/).
 2. Using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), install CentOS using the GUI.
 3. Do not use VirtualBox Manager to login; use SSH.
 4. Using VirtualBox, install CentOS again using the TUI. Go through the manual process of choosing package groups, configuration, etc.
   * Tip: Press tab during the 60 seconds in the screen with the prompt "Install CentOS 7" and add " text" to the vmlinuz command
 5. Using your TUI installation, update CentOS to have the latest packages, and install `java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel`. 
 6. Clone the newly updated box, and name it Golden Image.
 7. Create a snapshot of your Golden Image.
 8. Using your Golden Image, create a file in it: `touch /etc/hello_world`.
 9. Revert the snapshot.
 10. Move back to the latest snapshot.

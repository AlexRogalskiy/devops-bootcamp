# Networking

The following chapter requires some basic networking knowledge. This section
will cover the basics of networking in order to get everyone up to speed with
the knowledge they'll need for the remainder of the Bootcamp.

## IP Addresses

- IP Addresses are a series of numbers which represent a single device
on a network, similar to a home address referring to a specific building in a
city.
- There are two versions of IP Address, but it is more common to see IPv4
addresses, which are represented by four numbers separated by periods, such as
`172.217.0.46`.
- Each device on a network is given a unique IP address, sometimes manually,
but more often automatically.
- A single device can have more that one IP address that refers to it, but no
two machines on the same network should ever share an IP.

## Hostnames

- A hostname is an alternative way to specify an IP Address.
- Hostnames look like regular web addresses like `google.com`, and are turned
into IP Addresses in a process called DNS resolution.
- One important hostname is `localhost`, which refers to the computer itself.
Your own computer can be referred to by its own IP, `localhost`, or the
loopback IP `127.0.0.1`, which always refers to itself.

## Ports

- Ports are numbers represent different connections that a device can
have at the same time, similar to letters addressed to different people
at the same physical address.
- Often, a port is denoted following a hostname and
separated by a colon, such as `localhost:8080`.
- Servers generally expect communication on specific ports, and they won't
respond to communication on the wrong port, even if the IP is correct.

Some services and network traffic tend to run on known ports. Some of these
ports are:
- SSH, port 22
- HTTP, port 80
- HTTPS, port 443

## Subnets

Ranges of IP addresses are often divided into networks. When
we have several devices on the same network, some portion of the address
defines the network address, while the remainder defines the device, or host,
address.

When describing networks a common method is to use CIDR notation. CIDR notation
uses an IP address followed by a slash and another number from 1 to 32.
For example `192.168.0.36/24`.
The second number denotes the number of bits that make up the network address,
when the IP is interpreted as binary. The remainder of the bits are the host
portion of the address.
